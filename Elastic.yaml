This configuration block defines the different phases of the Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) policy for an Elasticsearch index. Let's break down each part:

hot Phase:

min_age: "0s": This specifies that the index will start in the "hot" phase as soon as it is created (i.e., there is no minimum age requirement).
actions: This section specifies the actions to be taken during the "hot" phase.
set_priority: Sets the index priority to 100. This can be useful for influencing shard allocation in a mixed cluster where indices have different priorities.
rollover: Configures the conditions for index rollover during the "hot" phase.
max_age: "1d": Specifies that a new index should be created if the current index is older than 1 day.
max_primary_shard_size: "30g": Specifies that a new index should be created if the primary shard size exceeds 30 gigabytes.
delete Phase:

min_age: "14d": Specifies that the index will enter the "delete" phase when it is at least 14 days old.
actions: This section specifies the actions to be taken during the "delete" phase.
delete: {}: Deletes the index. Once an index reaches the specified minimum age in the "delete" phase, it will be deleted as part of the ILM policy.
In summary, this ILM policy defines that during the "hot" phase, a new index will be created if the current index is older than 1 day or if the primary shard size exceeds 30 gigabytes. During the "delete" phase, indices that are at least 14 days old will be deleted.

This structure allows for the automatic management of indices based on time and size considerations, ensuring that data is efficiently organized and retained according to your specified criteria.
